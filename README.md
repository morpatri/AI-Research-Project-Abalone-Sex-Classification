# AI-Research-Project-Abalone-Sex-Classification
## Abstract
This project built a machine learning model to predict the sex of abalone specimens (Male, Female, or Infant) using physical measurements, including length, diameter, height, whole weight, shucked weight, viscera weight, and shell weight. Using PyCaret’s classification module, several algorithms were trained and evaluated on the UCI Abalone dataset. At first, models reached only about 54% accuracy without hyperparameter tuning or stacking. After applying hyperparameter optimization and creating a stacked model that combined the best-performing learners, accuracy rose to around 86% with a weighted F1-score of 0.86, showing strong predictive ability. The project demonstrates how automated workflows, including model comparison, tuning, and stacking, can achieve high performance on complex classification problems.
